== About ==

The 'Stick to That Language' extension for MediaWiki will allow to choose an
interface language. The 'uselang' url parameter is used to set that language
for the current page and will be added to all links to other internal pages.
This extension was designed to avoid cookies to remember the chosen language.

This extension causes cache fragmentation. This means each page will be stored
in the parser cache separately for each language after it got called once.
Usage of the 'uselang' parameter as described above might disable the squid-
cache from functioning. This might be solved by adjusting the squid caches
configuration.
